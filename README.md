Hi I'm Gene and this is my fullstack project that I worked on!

My partner and I used PostgreSQL and Flask in order to create a web interface that receptionists can use in order to manipulate and read patient data easily and intuitively. We customized the interface for the needed functions for the particular business.

As the code and details of this project contains sensitive information, please email me @ geneparkmcs@gmail.com in order to request access.

Thank you for understanding,
