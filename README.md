# Full Stack Developer | NOW PAIN CLINIC

During my time working at NOW Pain Clinic, I was responsible for modernizing the clinic’s patient data management system and building a more efficient interface for the staff.

## What I worked on:

- **Database Migration & Optimization**: I migrated the clinic's patient data from outdated MS Access and Excel files to a more robust SQL database using PostgreSQL, Python, Flask, and MS Access. This resulted in a **99.6% faster search time** and a **93% reduction in update times**.
  
- **Building a User-Friendly Interface**: I created a locally-hosted web interface for the clinic's receptionists, making it easier for them to manage patient information and book appointments. The interface was built with **Flask**, **Python**, **CSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**, and was designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

- **Multi-Page Functionality**: I used **Flask** to connect multiple pages such as booking appointments, adding and editing patient information, and maintaining a calendar, all seamlessly linked to the SQL backend. This allowed the receptionists to perform a variety of tasks from a single, integrated interface.

- **Back-End Integration**: I integrated the front-end interface with the back-end SQL database using **Psycopg** in Python, ensuring seamless communication between the user interface and the data storage system.

This project significantly improved the clinic’s data management efficiency and user experience for non-technical staff.
